# C# Application Development

This hands-on course builds upon COMP 1451 or equivalent knowledge of object oriented programming.
Students who already understand OOP learn to build graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and design Windows application software.
The focus of this course is an introduction to C# programming with Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and the .NET Framework 4.7 
for Windows application development. Labs and assignments are designed to reinforce Microsoft industry standards and best practices.
Topics include: Windows Forms and controls, event-driven programming and effective application debugging.
Students will be prepared to move on to more advanced C# in COMP 3618 Advanced .NET Application Development and COMP 3973
